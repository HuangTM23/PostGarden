He has also referred to Canada as \"the 51st state\" - a jab that has been met with a mix of anxiety and an uncharactaristically fierce display of patriotism.He has had an effect not just on how Canadians shop and travel, but on the country's domestic politics and world view.Here are five ways Trump has had an impact on Canada.",

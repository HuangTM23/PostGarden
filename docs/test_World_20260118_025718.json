An internet blackout has made it extremely difficult to get clear information.In a speech on Saturday, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said thousands had been killed and blamed the US for the deaths.US PresidentDonald Trump recently urged Iranian demonstrators to \"keep protesting\" and threatened military intervention if security forces kill them.",

The other, called the \"Gaza Executive Board\", is responsible for overseeing all on-the-ground work of yet another administrative group, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG).That committee is made up of supposedly technocratic, apolitical Palestinians, led by Dr Ali Shaath, a civil engineer by training who's held ministerial positions in the Palestinian Authority.But of the seven members of the founding Executive Board, six are Americans - including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other members of Trump's inner circle like his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Steve Witkoff, who is US Special Envoy to the Middle East, but also a friend of the president and a fellow real estate developer.",

            "content0": "Credit card debt is an increasingly heavy burden for millions of Americans.Selena Cooper, 26, is among those dealing with the strain. A former paralegal at the Social Security Administration, she was left without a stable income when the US government shut down a few months ago. She lost her job permanently after Christmas.Cooper first missed her credit card payments in October, when her paycheques ground to a halt. Since then, she said her debt across her three credit cards has accumulated to $6,000.Last month, her card issuers Capital One and American Express notified her that they were raising her interest rates due to late payments. The rate on her Capital One cards doubled to 16%, while the one on her Amex jumped from 10% to 18%, she said.Credit card rates have caught the attention of US President Donald Trump. Last week, heproposed capping themat 10% for one year from 20 January - an idea that Cooper said \"would help a little bit, but it's still not going to get me out of debt\".Cooper, who lives in Columbia, South Carolina, is now leaning on her photography business for income. \"It'll pay small bills - but not my credit card debt,\" she said.",

            "content0": "A dispute that began over heating a dish in a microwave has ended with two Indian students winning a $200,000 settlement from a US university.Aditya Prakash and his fiancee, Urmi Bhattacheryya, told the BBC they filed a civil rights lawsuit against the University of Colorado, Boulder, after they faced a series of \"microaggressions and retaliatory actions\" following the microwave incident.The harassment began, the lawsuit alleged, after a university staff member objected to Prakash heating up his lunch of palak paneer - one of northern India's most popular dishes, made of pureed spinach and paneer (considered an Indian equivalent of cottage cheese) - in a microwave on campus, because of the way it smelled.In response to the BBC's questions, the university said it could not comment on the \"specific circumstances\" surrounding the students' claims of discrimination and harassment due to privacy laws, but added it was \"committed to fostering an inclusive environment for all students, faculty and staff regardless of national origin, religion, culture and other classes protected under US laws and by university policies\".\"When these allegations arose in 2023, we took them seriously and adhered to established, robust processes to address them, as we do with all claims of discrimination and harassment. We reached an agreement with the students in September [2025] and deny any liability in this case,\" the university said.Prakash said for them, the point of the lawsuit was not the money. \"It was about making a point - that there are consequences to discriminating against Indians for their 'Indianness'.\"The lawsuit has received significant media coverage in India since it was first reported last week, starting a conversation around what many have described as \"food racism\" in Western countries. Many Indians on social media have shared their own experiences of facing ridicule over their food habits abroad.Some have also pointed out that discrimination over food is rampant in India as well, where non-vegetarian food is banned in many schools and colleges over perceptions of it being impure or dirty. People from disadvantaged castes and north-eastern states often face bias over their food habits, with some complaining about the smell of the ingredients they use.And it's not just Indian or South Asian food - communities from Africa, Latin America and other parts of Asia have also shared their experiences of being shamed over their food habits.Prakash and Bhattacheryya claim their ordeal began in September 2023. Prakash, a PhD student in the Anthropology Department at the university, was microwaving his lunch of palak paneer when a British staff member allegedly remarked that his food was giving off a \"pungent\" odour and told him that there was a rule against heating foods with strong odours in that microwave.Prakash said the rule wasn't mentioned anywhere and when he later inquired about which foods were considered pungent, he was told that sandwiches were not, while curry was.",

            "content0": "While speaking at the Davos summit on Tuesday, French president Emmanuel Macron drew attention for his stern rebuke of US leader Donald Trump's threat to tariff eight European countries opposed to his proposed takeover of Greenland.But another aspect of Macron's speech also made an impression: his choice of eyewear.The French leader wore a striking pair of blue reflective aviator sunglasses indoors while addressing world leaders at the World Economic Forum.While Macron did not explain the reason for the accessory during his speech, French reports have attributed it to an ongoing medical condition.Last week, he appeared at a military event in southern France with a red eye and at one point donned a similar pair of sunglasses.While addressing troops, he downplayed his condition and said it was \"totally benign\" and \"completely insignificant\", adding: \"Please pardon the unsightly appearance of my eye.\"Macron even joked about it, calling it \"l'oeil du tigre\" or the \"eye of the tiger\", in a reference to rock band Survivor's song used in the 1982 boxing movie Rocky III.\"For those who get the reference, it's a sign of determination,\" he said.French reports said that Macron appeared to have a sub-conjunctival haemorrhage, which is a broken blood vessel in his eye.It is harmless, painless and does not affect vision. It also does not cause permanent injury to the eye as it usually clears within a fortnight.It sometimes occurs when a person sneezes or coughs vigorously, or pokes or rubs their eye. Those with diabetes and high blood pressure are more at risk of suffering from the condition.",

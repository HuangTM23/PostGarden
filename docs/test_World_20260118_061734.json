An internet blackout has made it extremely difficult to get clear information.US PresidentDonald Trump recently urged Iranian demonstrators to \"keep protesting\" and threatened military intervention if security forces kill them.",

In exchange, China will lower retaliatory tariffs on key Canadian agricultural products.Experts told the BBC the move represents a significant shift in Canada's policy on China, one that is shaped by ongoing uncertainty with the US, its largest trade partner.\"The prime minister is saying, essentially, that Canada has agency too, and that it's not going to just sit and wait for the United States,\" said Eric Miller, a Washington DC based trade adviser and president of the Rideau Potomac Strategy Group.China and Canada announce tariffs relief after high-stakes meetingCarney faces delicate balancing act in China visitFour things the US wants from Canada on trade",

The other, called the \"Gaza Executive Board\", is responsible for overseeing all on-the-ground work of yet another administrative group, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG).That committee is made up of supposedly technocratic, apolitical Palestinians, led by Dr Ali Shaath, a civil engineer by training who's held ministerial positions in the Palestinian Authority.But of the seven members of the founding Executive Board, six are Americans - including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other members of Trump's inner circle like his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Steve Witkoff, who is US Special Envoy to the Middle East, but also a friend of the president and a fellow real estate developer.",

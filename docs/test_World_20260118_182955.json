The kids call them \"Young 40s\".The memes have made Ji's beloved Nike Air Jordans and Stüssy T-shirts the butt of jokes—and the source of much indignation.\"I'm just buying and wearing things I've liked for a long time, now that I can afford them,\" he tells the BBC. \"Why is this something to be attacked for?\"",

The flares instantly set fire to the surrounding acoustic foam panels, installed to deaden the sound.\"It was immediate,\" Gina tells BBC News. \"It got bad very fast. The backflash just happened that quick.\"Then came \"a black rain of smoke\", Gina adds, the heat melting, then shattering, glass lights above people's heads. Gina and her fiance made for the nearest exit, a door to the right of the club's small stage. A bouncer blocked their way, but Gina has no idea why.That's when \"a stampede\" began for the main exit, she says, and Fred desperately pushed her ahead in the crowd. Gina says \"bodies were piling up\" as people scrambled to get out - and her last memory was making it through the door to safety before passing out.When she woke from an induced coma 11 weeks later, Gina learned her fiance had saved her life but had lost his in the fire.",

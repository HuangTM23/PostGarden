            "content0": "Back in November, I posted a note on LinkedIn about brain fog. I dashed it out in about 10 minutes - how for the first time in my 20-year career, I ended up using notes while doing live TV news thanks to the perimenopause brain fog. I didn't expect many replies.To my surprise, it sparked a national conversation. I was overwhelmed with wonderfully supportive messages – nearly 400 comments on LinkedIn and dozens of private messages, and hundreds more beneatha piece about iton the BBC News website. Many of them followed similar lines: calling me \"brave\" for speaking out. Or thanking me for \"normalising\" brain fog.I didn't feel particularly brave (or normal!) at the time - but it did spell out to me just how much shame and stigma was attached to some of the symptoms of perimenopause and menopause, even though it affects pretty much half the population at some point in their life.Hollywood stars like Oprah Winfrey and Halle Berry have spoken out about their own experiences of menopause and its impact, as have TV presenters Davina McCall and Lorraine Kelly. Gwyneth Paltrow called for a \"rebrand\" of menopause back in 2018.And there have been some changes. For example, menopause screening is to be officially incorporated intoNHS health checks in Englandoffered to women over 40 from this year. Plus, an Employment Relations Bill means that UK employers of 250 or more need to have \"menopause action plans\". This comes into effect from April 2027 (and on a voluntary basis from this April).Yet a self-selecting survey of around 1,600 women, published in October by University College London, found that more than 75% felt that they are not well-informed enough about menopause. Which suggests that something is going amiss.",

            "content0": "In his first public testimony about his criminal investigations of Donald Trump, former special counsel Jack Smith said the president was responsible for the violence on 6 January 2021, when hundreds of rioters stormed the US Capitol.Smith told a congressional committee that he believed his team had “proof beyond a reasonable doubt” and enough evidence to win convictions against Trump in both cases they had prosecuted - one into Trump's alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election and the other into accusations that he illegally retained classified documents after leaving office the first time.Trump pleaded not guilty in both cases, which were dropped once he returned to the White House last year.On New Year's Eve, the Republican-led committee released 255 pages of transcripts of testimony Smith gave in private about the criminal cases, but Thursday's five-hour hearing was the public's first chance to hear him speak about it.The lawmakers broke little new ground in their questions, with Republicans repeating accusations that the prosecutions were partisan attacks on Trump and that Smith was spying on certain Republican lawmakers by seeking subpoenas for their phone records. Democrats, meanwhile, targeted Trump's alleged wrongdoing involving the 6 January riot and applauded Smith and his investigations.Here are four takeaways from the hearing.",
